        <p class="main__paragraph">
          One of the most effective therapy techniques I have learned in 30
          years of practice is Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) Meridian
          Tapping. I have been using this with clients for more than a decade.
          EFT is a very simple technique to master, where you use your own
          fingers to tap on certain points on the body around the face and chest
          as a way to reduce stress, trauma, anxiety and many other problems.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          As you are tapping, I am guiding you to verbally address the concrete
          details of the problem. Think of it as combining relaxation,
          self-hypnosis, and a direct means to changing cognitive blocks.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Clients who use EFT are amazed at how quickly and efficiently it
          works. I've observed tension reduced from an 8 to a 2 or even 0 on a
          10 point scale in short periods of time. I've noticed anxiety or anger
          reduced in the same manner. I have seen the intensity of traumatic
          memories drop from 10 (or off the graph) to a point where clients say
          they cannot bring up the memory any longer. This process helps reduce
          feelings that accompany pain, therefore, the pain level is reduced.
          I've seen EFT work over and over again on many issues in addition to
          those mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          EFT is based on traditional Chinese medicine (acupuncture). With 5000
          years of documented history, the traditional Chinese believe that we
          have energy flowing through our body, so when the energy is not
          flowing right or is stuck somewhere, that is what makes people sick.
          Using herbs and needles on the body, acupuncture works to get this
          energy flowing correctly, so the body can cure itself and return to
          its natural state.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Professionals in the mental health field have been working with this
          particular concept of shifting energy for approximately 35 years. EFT
          shifts energy, in the same manner needles in acupuncture do, for
          addressing psychological and behavioral problems.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          EFT Meridian tapping is easy to learn and apply to reduce
          distress. It is possible to use it anytime, whenever you require it,
          not only during treatment sessions.
