        <h2 class="main__title">Welcome to Asheville Counseling Center</h2>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Hello, My name is Guy Morganstein with Asheville Counseling Center,
          and I help people make changes for healthier living and better
          relationships. Maybe I can help you.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          I realize that it is often difficult to take this first step in
          getting assistance for problems you have been unable to resolve on
          your own. Reaching out to another for help, not knowing what to
          expect, or even how the whole counseling process works can be scary. I
          am here, at Asheville Counseling Center, to let you know that as a
          Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor (LCMHC) with over 30 years of mental health
          and substance abuse counseling experience, I believe that you
          absolutely CAN make changes necessary to improve your mood,
          relationships, and quality of life.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          My focus is on helping you, your partner, or your family identify and
          practice real skills to solve problems, create lasting changes and
          reach your goals. I have helped couples improve communication,
          rekindle their sense of intimacy, and avert patterns which may result
          in conflict. I have also worked for many years helping children and
          teens who have behavior and mood issues.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          I help people with excessive anxiety, stress, depression, anger
          issues, alcohol and drug problems, trauma, grief and loss,
          life transitions, abuse, chronic illness, and <a href="https://lgbtq.unc.edu/" class="link">LGBTQ</a> issues.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          In addition to traditional talk therapy, I use a simple tapping
          procedure, called <a href="emotional-freedom-techniques" class="link">EFT</a>. EFT is an easy to learn technique, where you tap on certain places on
          the body around the face and chest to reduce or extinguish anxiety,
          stress, traumatic memories, anger and many other problems. Healing
          effects can often be felt in just a few minutes. Once you have learned
          how to do EFT, you can use it anytime, whenever you need it, not only
          during therapy sessions.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          I provide professional and caring counseling in a safe, confidential
          and compassionate environment that is respectful of your desires and
          needs. You can say what you need, be who you are, and make the changes
          you know it is time to make.
