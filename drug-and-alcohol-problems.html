          Drug and Alcohol problems: Are you concerned about your drug or
          alcohol use? Have others expressed concerns about your use? One area I
          have worked with throughout my career has been drug and alcohol
          problems, and recovery from these problems. I have facilitated
          hundreds of substance abuse groups. I have worked in substance abuse
          specific programs with both teenagers and adults.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Anxiety: One of my areas of expertise is helping people overcome
          anxiety and worry. I utilize EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), relaxation
          skills, breathing exercises and other methods.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Depression: This is very common among adults and children. I have
          extensive experience helping people feel less depressed through
          exploring the root causes and taking practical steps for a better
          outlook on life.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Bipolar Disorder: This is sometimes referred to as Manic Depressive
          Disorder and is characterized by severe changes in mood and energy
          levels. I work with people to feel more balanced in daily life.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Anger Management: Everyone gets angry. The problem is not that you get
          angry but instead what you do when you're angry. I help you learn
          to manage your anger so it is not impacting your life and others
          negatively.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Life Transitions: When your life changes for good or bad, it can be
          hard to “keep it together” and figure out what direction to take. I
          can help you sort it out and remain calm while working through the
          transition.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Emotional problems resulting from chronic illness: Emotional problems
          often accompany physical health issues, especially chronic issues.
          Whether you were born with the condition or developed it later in
          life, you or your family may benefit by talking to a professional to
          navigate living with your illness or being a caregiver.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Other Areas I work with include: LGBTQ issues, Financial Stress, Fear,
          Physical, Sexual and Emotional Abuse, Domestic Violence, Senior
          Issues, Job Issues, Grief and Loss.
