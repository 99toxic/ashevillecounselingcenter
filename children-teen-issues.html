        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Children of any age can have real problems that can result in feelings
          of depression, anxiety, loneliness, guilt, or a combination of some,
          or all of these emotions. The issues that children and teens
          experience can be much different than how adults experience them, and
          need to be addressed differently. Some signs that indicate your child
          may be struggling emotionally include behavioral changes, declining
          school performance, increase in desiring solitude or sleep, unusual
          weight gain or loss, or lack of motivation. Are you concerned your
          child is making bad choices?

          For over half of my 30+ years of counseling, I worked primarily
          with children and teens, in a variety of settings, including:

            School-based therapy at several schools (including at Enka High
            School and Middle School and Hominy Elementary)
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-list__item">
            Home-based programs where the primary objective was to prevent
            children from being removed from the home, either due to their own
            criminality, or abuse or neglect from the parents.
          </li>

          In private practice, I currently help children with a variety of

          I help children and teens feel comfortable by letting them open up at
          their own pace. I offer a non-judgmental, compassionate and safe
          environment. I treat each client with respect in an individualized
          manner to meet their emotional needs.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          I also work with parents to help them communicate efficiently and
          assertively and remain calm in stressful interactions with their
          children. This gives a sense of control to the parents and helps
          prevent discussions from escalating.
