          "I have been working in the mental health and substance abuse field
          for most of my adult life. This journey started for me in high school,
          when I completed an internship at a community mental health center.
          After 10 years of working in the field, I went back to school and got
          my Masters degree in Counseling from <a href="http://www.tnstate.edu/" class="link">Tennessee State University</a> in
          1996 . Over time, I have worked in diverse settings, including several
          years as a school-based counselor at Enka Middle and High Schools, as
          well as Hominy Elementary."
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          For over a decade Guy worked in a home-based counseling program,
          focusing on helping families avoid removal of children due to their
          own delinquency or abuse and neglect from a parent. He also worked at large community
          mental health facilities, including the Blue Ridge Center and New
          Vista Behavioral Health Center in Asheville, NC. For many years he
          facilitated anger management and domestic violence groups, as well as
          substance abuse groups.
