        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Over the past several years marriage counseling and couples counseling
          has become a passion of mine. I've been helping children and families
          throughout my career, so it is natural that I now also serve couples.
          Whether you want to see your relationship grow and thrive, or are in a
          major relationship crisis, I can help. Even if your partner is not
          willing to come to counseling at this time, you coming by yourself can
          improve the situation. One person doing things differently can create
          a different outcome.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          My techniques are useful in helping couples learn how to improve communication, increase feelings of intimacy
          and avoid patterns which result in conflict. I do this through a mix of practical guidance, thoughtful exploration, problem-solving and education.
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          Using these proven techniques, I have seen couples become more
          harmonious and even move back together if they were living separately.
          Couples learn how to listen better, manage conflict, and show each
          other they care for one another.
